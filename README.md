Microfrontends are an architectural pattern based on the Unix philosophy to modularize frontends at a high level. To sum the Unix philosophy up in my own words:

> Do one thing well, work with others, use standardized interfaces.

## Developing Microfrontends with Webcomponents

At the [OOP2020](https://www.oop-konferenz.de/oop2020.html) I held a presentation about why webcomponents are the ideal basis for microfrontends. Please find the slides and an simple example in the subdirectory [/oop2020](/oop2020).

## Microfrontends to the Rescue

On January 24th, 2019 I've explained the Microfrontend Architecture Pattern on the Code Days 2019. The slides of the presentation are available in german on [Slidehare](https://www.slideshare.net/MarkLubkowitz/microfrontends-zur-rettung-frontends-auf-anwendungsebene-modularisieren). The key message is, that Microfrontends are an effective solution to leverage the complexity of the development of modern frontends by breaking them down into autonomous artifacts.
